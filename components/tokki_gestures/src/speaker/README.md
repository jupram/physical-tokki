# Speaker gestures

Speaker contributions in this folder are notification sounds, tones, or
preinstalled spoken-word WAV assets. Arbitrary text-to-speech is not part of
the embedded firmware contract.

`speaker.drink_water` plays a fixed offline-generated phrase. `speaker.chirp`
is explicitly a synthesized bird-like sound, not a field recording.
`speaker.alert` is a short neutral tone. A bark and parameterized greetings are
deferred rather than approximated under misleading action IDs.

## Speech asset provenance

`components/tokki_speaker/audio/drink_water.wav` was generated locally on
2026-09-15 using Windows SAPI and Microsoft David Desktop (English US), speaking
the original two-word text `Drink water` at rate -1. No downloaded recording,
external TTS service, voice imitation or personal data is used. Format is PCM,
16 kHz, mono, signed 16-bit; the generated phrase is 1.73 seconds long.

The reproducible source is `audio/generate-drink-water.ps1` in `tokki_speaker`.
It uses the machine's installed default SAPI voice, so output can differ by
machine. Review the voice choice and applicable voice distribution terms before
shipping beyond the hack prototype. Firmware scales PCM to the existing 20%
ceiling; the source WAV itself is not pre-scaled. Do not raise the ceiling to
compensate for a quiet voice without hardware review.
